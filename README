NAME
    RT::Extension::AttachmentWarning - Warn if the attachments in the
    session aren't what the user expects

DESCRIPTION
    Browsing to other tickets or starting other replies/comments while in
    the middle of another reply with already uploaded attachments can lead
    to surprising results due to how attachments are handled in the user's
    session.

    This extension catches when these unexpected leaks of attachments in and
    out of the reply/comment happen and prevents the ticket update with a
    warning to the user. While not solving the problem, it at least prevents
    replies going out with no attachments, or worse, the wrong, completely
    unrelated, attachments.

    The underlying problem will be solved in RT 4.2, making this extension
    unnecessary.

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
        May need root permissions

    Edit your /opt/rt4/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
        Add this line:

            Set(@Plugins, qw(RT::Extension::AttachmentWarning));

        or add "RT::Extension::AttachmentWarning" to your existing @Plugins
        line.

        This extension performs sanity checking on attachments, so it needs
        to be in the @Plugins list before any other extensions which massage
        the session attachments. If it's placed after any such extensions,
        you'll see false positive warnings.
